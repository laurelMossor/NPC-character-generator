          <p class="card-text">The idea for this NPC Generator is based on a personality test called the Big 5 or The Five Factor Model (FFM) which measures personality on five spectrums: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Ageeableness and Neuroticism.  What is unique about this is that it flips the idea around and rolls some dice to create a character based on randomized values for those characteristics.</p>
          <p class="card-text">You can read more about the FFM at one of the links below:</p>
